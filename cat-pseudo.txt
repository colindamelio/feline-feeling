++FELINE FEELINGS++

GAME: 
goal is to pet cat in correct location, 6 locations to pet cat, only one will give cat happy points, for a total of 
10 happy points! After two correct pets -> randomize petting area!
If user reaches 10 points winner! If user does not reach 10 points they lose. :(

    CREATE cat OBJECT with these properties:
     	 array of 6 elements: cat{head, back, tail, frontLegs, backLegs, tail}
        happy: 0 (show this on screen, left hand side)
     
     CREATE a randomizer METHOD (in cat object) which will:
            use math.random() + math.floor(to round) (0-5)-> to select one part of the array 
	     //i.e. math.random() gets 1 -> which is the back and that is where the cat purfurs being pet!
            

IMG of cat (split into 6 parts and each assigned to a div -> correspond to cat object)


ON REFRESH/PAGELOAD -> button to 'start' game with instructions   
        on mouseover + click (or touch on mobile) user pets cat
	    IF user pets cat in correct spot 
		++ to cat points (cat.happy())
   		after 2 correct pets - call randomizer method --> randomize area again
     		IF user reaches 10 points 
			see winning screen!
       	ELSE
		 user did not pet cat to goal happiness :(
		 game over screen
		 refresh page to play again

ASSETS:
   cat image (my drawings!) split into 6 img divs (in a css grid using grid-template-areas (2x3 grid)):
									   head back tail
									   front-legs belly back-legs
     
        +start screen with instructions
	 +cat happy face ~(head img), occurs when pet correctly + correct spot 
	 +cat sad face ~(head img), occurs when pet incorrectly + incorrect spot 
        +game over screen (if >60 seconds & under 10pts)
        +game winning screen (if 10pts in <60 seconds)
        +instructions on the right side (in html+css)


FOR RESPONSIVENESS:
	+cat/play area in a container
	+cat images in a css grid
	+resize with % for container
	+for mobile: set mouseover to touch
	+stack instructions + play area on mobile
 
           
STRETCH GOALS:
    +60 second timer 
    +toggle button (switches how the cat will be pet (up & down petting, left & right petting, circular petting??)
    +make image into a map (coordinates for each area ~ more responsive/better error handling of white space)
    +keydown instead of toggle (more key binds/methods to pet ~ unsure how to apply for mobile)
    +leaderboards
    +more cats!
    +more animations
    +sound effects
